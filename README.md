# Tableau-Citi-Bike_Analysis
Analyzing data from citi-bike
I started off my analysis in the Tableau Story by visualizing
every station by points on a map and used the tableau built in heat map to show the density of users over three years: 2018 2019 and 2020.
While going through the data I noticed a differences in uses for males and females. In the first dashboard and the second slide of the Story the data was analized looking at the differences between male and female. 
Males are significantly more likely to be the gender to be riding a bike through all 3 years, but females have the edge in riding for longer durations. Furthmore, the longest duration riders are those that chose to not answer the gender questions. The unknown riders went the fursthest but also the least amount of times riding.
In my second dashboard and the third slide of the story I wanted to look further into categorizing our riders by usertype. We have subscibers and customers(non-subscribers). Subscribers take the most trips by a significant majority. Most subscribers are also male. In all three years the number of rides rose, except for 2020 which might be able to account for by curent socioeconomic and pandemic climate. Of the user type and trips the non subscribing clients did have the longest trips. 
What I gained from this data is that males are the most likely riders and they are also the majority of subscribers. The furthest travelers are the females and non subscribers. I would direct my marketing towards male users as it may be more efficient to have bike trip durations shorter.
